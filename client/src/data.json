In addition to being homeless, many of them live with multiple health challenges. The main mental health diagnoses among our clients are schizophrenia and schizo-affective disorders, major depression and bipolar disorder.  Many clients also suffer from personality disorders, either in combination with these diagnoses or on their own. Physically, many of the women we serve, especially those who have been homeless for extended periods, live with chronic ailments including diabetes, hypertension, chronic pain (arthritic, lower back, knees), obesity and related comorbidities.",
